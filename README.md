[lolcommits](https://lolcommits.github.io/) takes a snapshot with your webcam
every time you git commit code, and archives a lolcat style image with it. Git
blame has never been so much fun!

Lolcommit plugins allow developers to add features by running code before or
after snapshots are taken. Installed plugin gems are automatically loaded before
the capturing process starts.

This gem showcases an example plugin. It prints short messages to the screen
before and after every lolcommit. After configuring the plugin to be enabled,
you'll see something like this for a capture:

    ‚ú®  Say cheese üòÅ !
    *** Preserving this moment in history.
    üì∏  Snap
    ‚ú®  wow! 9e6303c is your best looking commit yet! üòò  üíª

Use this repo to jump-start development on your own plugin. It has tests, docs
and hooks with useful tools; Travis, CodeClimate, Rdoc etc.

## Developing your own plugin

First, there are some things your gem *must* do to be loaded and executed:

* The gem name must have a `lolcommits-` prefix.
* Require `lolcommits` in your `gemspec` file as a development dependency.
* Include a class that inherits from `Lolcommits::Plugin::Base` (this will be
  the entry point to your plugin from the lolcommits gem).
* This main plugin class must meet the requirements explained below.

### Your Plugin Class

You plugin class must have a namespace and path that matches your gem name and
be in the gem's `LOAD_PATH` for example:

    # for a gem named: lolcommits-zapier
    # should have a plugin class inheriting like this:
    class Lolcommits::Plugin::Zapier < Lolcommits::Plugin::Base
      ...
    end
    # at lib/lolcommits/plugin/zapier.rb
    # required in a file at lib/lolcommits/zapier.rb

    # or a gem named: lolcommits-super_awesome
    # should have a plugin class like this:
    class Lolcommits::Plugin::SuperAwesome < Lolcommits::Plugin::Base
      ...
    end
    # required in a file at lib/lolcommits/super_awesome.rb

Three hooks points are available during the capture process.

* `:pre_capture` - executes before the capture starts, at this point you
  could alter the commit message/sha text.
* `:post_capture` - executes immediately after the camera captures, use this
  hook to manipulate the image (e.g. resize, apply filters, annotate).
* `:capture_ready` - executes after all `:post_capture` hooks have ran, at this
  point we consider the capture to be ready for exporting or sharing.

To execute code at these points you'll need to override these methods in your
plugin class:

* `def self.runner_order` - return the hooks this plugin should run at during
  the capture process (`:pre_capture`, `:post_capture` and/or `:capture_ready`).
* `def run_pre_capture`, `def run_post_capture` and/or `def run_capture_ready` -
  override with your plugin's behaviour.

### Plugin configuration

Available options can be defined in an Array (`@options` instance var) and/or a
Hash (by overriding the `default_options` method).

By default (on initialize), `@options` will be set to `[:enabled]`. This option
is mandatory since `enabled?` checks `configuration[:enabled] == true` before
any capture hooks can run.

Using a Hash to define default options allows you to:

- fall back to default values (or nil) if the user enters nothing when prompted
- define nested options (the user is prompted for each nested option key)

`configure_option_hash` will iterate over all options prompting the user for
input and building the configuration Hash.

Lolcommits will save this Hash to a YAML file. During the capture process the
configuration is loaded, parsed and available in the plugin class as
`configuration`. Or if you want to fall back to default values, you should use
the `config_option(*keys)` method to dig into the hash.

Alternatively you can override these methods to fully customise the
configuration process.

* `def configure_options!` - by default this prompts the user for option values
  (based on option names in the `@options` array) and returns a hash that will
  be persisted.
* `def enabled?` - by default checks if `configuration[:enabled] == true` to
  determine if the plugin should run.
* `def configured?` - checks the persisted config hash is present.
* `def valid_configuration?`- checks the persisted config hash is valid.

A `parse_user_input` method is available to help parse strings from STDIN to
Ruby objects (e.g. boolean, integer or nil values).

Users start plugin configuration with this lolcommits command;

    lolcommits --config
    # or
    lolcommits --config -p plugin-name

By default a plugin will only run it's capture hooks if:

* `valid_configuration?` returns true
* `enabled?` returns true

During plugin configuration, your plugin class will be initialized with the
optional `config` argument (and no runner). This allows you to read the existing
saved options during configuration. E.g. to show existing options back to the
user.

__NOTE__: If your plugin does not require configuration and should be enabled by
default (on gem install) you could override the `enabled?` method to always
return `true`. Uninstalling the gem will disable the plugin.

For more help, check out [the
documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/lolcommits/lolcommits-sample_plugin/Lolcommits/Plugin/SamplePlugin)
for this plugin, or take a look at [other
  lolcommit_plugins](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alolcommits-plugin+org%3Alolcommits&type=Repositories) in the wild.

### The Lolcommits 'runner'

The only required argument for your plugin class initializer is a
[Lolcommits::Runner](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/blob/master/lib/lolcommits/runner.rb)
instance. By default, the base plugin initializer will set this in the `runner`
instance var for use in your plugin's code.

* `runner.message` - the commit message
* `runner.sha` - the sha for the current commit
* `runner.vcs_info` - a reference to the
  [Lolcommits::VCSInfo](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/blob/master/lib/lolcommits/vcs_info.rb)
  instance
* `runner.config` - a reference to the
  [Lolcommits::Configuration](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/blob/master/lib/lolcommits/configuration.rb)
  instance

After the capturing process completes, (i.e. in the `run_post_capture` or
`run_capture_ready` hooks) these methods will reveal the captured snapshot file.

* `runner.snapshot_loc` - the raw image file
* `runner.main_image` - the processed image file, resized, with text overlay
  applied (or any other effects from other plugins)

Take a look at the
[Lolcommits::Runner](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/blob/master/lib/lolcommits/runner.rb)
for more details.

### Testing your plugin

It's a good idea to include tests with your gem. To make this easier for you,
the main lolcommits gem includes helpers to work with command line IO and Git
repos.

    # add one (or both) of these to your plugin's test_helper file
    require 'lolcommits/test_helpers/git_repo'
    require 'lolcommits/test_helpers/fake_io'

    # and include either (or both) modules in your test
    include Lolcommits::TestHelpers::GitRepo
    include Lolcommits::TestHelpers::FakeIO

Use the following methods to manage a test repo:

    setup_repo                # create the test repo
    commit_repo_with_message  # perform a git commit in the test repo
    last_commit               # commit info for the last test repo commit
    teardown_repo             # destroy the test repo
    in_repo(&block)           # run lolcommits within the test repo

For STDIN and capturing IO use the `fake_io_capture` method. E.g. to capture the
output of the `configure_options` method, while sending the string input 'true'
(followed by a carriage return) to STDIN:

    output = fake_io_capture(inputs: %w(true)) do
      configured_plugin_options = plugin.configure_options!
    end

For more examples take a look at the [tests in this
repo](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits-sample_plugin/blob/master/test/lolcommits/plugin/sample_plugin_test.rb).

### General advice

Use this gem as a starting point, renaming files, classes etc. Or build a new
plugin gem from scratch with:

    bundle gem lolcommits-my_plugin

For more examples, take a look at other published [lolcommit
plugins](https://github.com/lolcommits).
