lolcommits takes a snapshot with your webcam every time you git commit code, and
archives a lolcat style image with it. Git blame has never been so much fun!

Lolcommit plugins are automatically loaded before the capturing process starts.
The flexible class design allows developers to write their own code to execute
before or after snapshots are taken.

This gem showcases an example plugin (using the post-capture hook). It simply
prints a short message to the screen after every lolcommit. Something like this;


    âœ¨  wow! 9e6303c is your best looking commit yet! ðŸ˜˜  ðŸ’»

You can use this repo to jump-start building your own plugin. It has good tests,
docs and working hooks to useful services (Travis, CodeClimate etc.) See below
for more information on how to get started.

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 2.0.0
* A webcam
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) (optional) for animated gif capturing

## Installation

Follow the [install steps](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits#requirements) for
lolcommits first. Then run the following to install this plugin:

    $ gem install lolcommits-plugin-sample

## Usage

After installing, configure and enabled this plugin with:

    $ lolcommits --config
    # or
    $ lolcommits --config -p plugin-sample

Set enabled to `true`. Every lolcommit now comes with it's own short, snappy
emoji filled message!

## Developing your own plugin


## Tests

Run tests for this gem with:

    $ rake test

Minitest is used for testing. The main lolcommits gem provides a helper module
to easily work with IO and manage git repos and commits for testing.

To use these in your tests:

    # add this to your test_helper
    require 'lolcommits/test_helpers/git_repo'
    require 'lolcommits/test_helpers/fake_io'

    # and include this module in your test
    include Lolcommits::TestHelpers::GitRepo
    include Lolcommits::TestHelpers::FakeIO

See the existing tests and module code for what methods are available.

## Docs

Generate docs for this gem with:

    $ rake rdoc

## History

Until recently, all plugins lived inside the main lolcommits gem. We are in the
process of updating them to exist as inidividual gems, loaded with the new gem
plugin manager. Rubygems versioning can then take care of managing compatibility
with main gem.
